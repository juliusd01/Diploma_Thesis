# Propensity Score Matching (PSM)

## Disadvantages

- One has to make strong assumption that observable variables do not influence treatment assignment

### Nearest Neighbor with Caliper
- caliper width
- with replacement or not
- how many control units matched to one treated unit

### Radius Matching


### Kernel Matching
