# Thesis: Combining Causal Inference and Machine Learning: An Application to "The long-run effects of sports club vouchers for primary school children" (Marcus et al., 2022)

## First Step: Replicating the Diff-in-Diff Results by the authors
- Find code in folder [replication](replication)
- Same results were generated using Stata

## Second Step: Estimate First-Difference to check if there are significantly different estimates from second difference
- Check results of first difference in folder [output](CausalMachineLearning/output)

## Third Step: Estimate Propensity Scores and ATT
- Check out folder [inference](CausalMachineLearning/inference)
